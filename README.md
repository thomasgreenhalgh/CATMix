The demo below shows the workings of a tool in Nuke that I created to help with keeping scripts tidy and simple for the user. Under the hood all the calculations ensure grading CG AOVs can be done in tandem with category lights (CATs) specifically using Arnold renderer's output. This will get a massive overhaul for v2 to make sure it has its uses for any render layers coming through.
